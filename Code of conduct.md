 # Code of Conduct of Group 21

## Introduction to the Code of Conduct:



Over time, members of every team and work group develop
unique ways of interacting with one another. Effective interpersonal
communication among team members, as well as successful communication with
managers and employees outside the team, are critical components of team
performance. Team success is determined by how a team makes decisions, assigns
work, and holds members accountable. Why leave team member interactions to
chance when they have the potential to have such a powerful impact on team
success? This is an excellent opportunity to establish team relationship
guidelines or team norms. The discussion that the team is within the facility
and that the team concept must include all staff within the facility is an
excellent first step.



Team norms are a set of rules or guidelines that a team
establishes to shape the interaction of team members with one another and with
employees outside the team. Team norms can be created initially and then added
to or modified as the team sees fit. Once established, these team norms are
used to guide team behaviour and to evaluate how well teams interact. Team
norms allow team members to call each other out on any behaviour that is
detrimental to the team's success.



Team norms can cover as many topics as the team deems
necessary for effective operation. They must be written and posted, and team
members must be given the opportunity to discuss commitment – include a review
process. 



With effective team norms in place, your team will be
able to focus on its business purpose. The team has been founded to work
together, continuously improve and achieve strategic goals. Don’t let
ineffective relationships and interactions sabotage the team’s work. 



## Team Norm essentials.



### Important aspects of interpersonal and team interaction: 



        
Team membership as coworkers – all team
members are equal; every team member's opinion will be thoughtfully considered;
every team member will keep all commitments by the agreed-upon due date; and
every team member agrees to constantly assess whether team members are
honouring their commitment to the team norms.



        
Team member communication: team members
will speak respectfully to one another, will not speak down to one another, and
will positively recognise and thank one another for team contributions.



        
In meetings, team members will listen
without interrupting; hold no side or competing conversations; follow the rules
for effective meetings; attend meetings on time; always work from an agenda.



        
Team structure and function: leadership
will rotate monthly.



      
Team communication with other employees, including
managers: team members will ensure agreement on what and when to
communicate; complaints about team members will be addressed first within the
team.



        
Team problem solving, conflict resolution,
and decision making: team members will make decisions by consensus, but if
a timely consensus cannot be reached, the majority will rule; conflicts will be
resolved directly with the parties involved. 



 


### Successful team building, which results in effective, focused work teams, necessitates paying attention to each of the following:




Clear Expectations: for the team's
performance and expected outcomes.



        
Context: Do team members understand why
they are on the team? Do they understand how the team-building strategy will
help the organisation achieve its goals? Is the team aware of how its work fits
into the larger picture of the organization's goals, principles, vision, and
values?



        
Commitment: Do team members want to be a
part of the team? Do team members believe the team's mission is important? Are
team members committed to achieving the team's mission and goals? Do team
members expect their skills to grow and develop on the team? Are team members
excited and challenged by the team opportunity?



 



### As professionals, we will work hard to: 




Be on time, adhere to agenda item time limits,
and plan to stay for the duration of the meeting. 



      
Communicate directly and openly. 




Be polite, listen carefully, and respect other
people's opinions. 




Participate fully in the group exchange by
avoiding sideline conversations, cross-talk, and distracting behaviours. 




Be adaptable and open to new ideas and changes. 




Keep your focus on the task at hand and don't
get distracted by other, unrelated issues. 




Assume positive attention from others, and give
them the benefit of the doubt. 




Be solution-focused, looking for opportunities,
challenges, and opportunities, rather than dwelling on past slights,
roadblocks, or excuses.




Strive for consensus when making decisions; if
that fails, a simple majority vote will be used. 




Respect that decision, even if it is not in your
best interests. Make decisions based on what is best for the children, families,
and centre, not what is expedient or easy.
