- # Code of Conduct of Group 21
-
-## Introduction to the Code of Conduct:
-
-
-
-Over time, members of every team and work group develop
-unique ways of interacting with one another. Effective interpersonal
-communication among team members, as well as successful communication with
-managers and employees outside the team, are critical components of team
-performance. Team success is determined by how a team makes decisions, assigns
-work, and holds members accountable. Why leave team member interactions to
-chance when they have the potential to have such a powerful impact on team
-success? This is an excellent opportunity to establish team relationship
-guidelines or team norms. The discussion that the team is within the facility
-and that the team concept must include all staff within the facility is an
-excellent first step.
-
-
-
-Team norms are a set of rules or guidelines that a team
-establishes to shape the interaction of team members with one another and with
-employees outside the team. Team norms can be created initially and then added
-to or modified as the team sees fit. Once established, these team norms are
-used to guide team behaviour and to evaluate how well teams interact. Team
-norms allow team members to call each other out on any behaviour that is
-detrimental to the team's success.
-
-
-
-Team norms can cover as many topics as the team deems
-necessary for effective operation. They must be written and posted, and team
-members must be given the opportunity to discuss commitment – include a review
-process. 
-
-
-
-With effective team norms in place, your team will be
-able to focus on its business purpose. The team has been founded to work
-together, continuously improve and achieve strategic goals. Don’t let
-ineffective relationships and interactions sabotage the team’s work. 
-
-
-
-## Team Norm essentials.
-
-
-
-### Important aspects of interpersonal and team interaction: 
-
-
-
-        
-Team membership as coworkers – all team
-members are equal; every team member's opinion will be thoughtfully considered;
-every team member will keep all commitments by the agreed-upon due date; and
-every team member agrees to constantly assess whether team members are
-honouring their commitment to the team norms.
-
-
-
-        
-Team member communication: team members
-will speak respectfully to one another, will not speak down to one another, and
-will positively recognise and thank one another for team contributions.
-
-
-
-        
-In meetings, team members will listen
-without interrupting; hold no side or competing conversations; follow the rules
-for effective meetings; attend meetings on time; always work from an agenda.
-
-
-
-        
-Team structure and function: leadership
-will rotate monthly.
-
-
-
-      
-Team communication with other employees, including
-managers: team members will ensure agreement on what and when to
-communicate; complaints about team members will be addressed first within the
-team.
-
-
-
-        
-Team problem solving, conflict resolution,
-and decision making: team members will make decisions by consensus, but if
-a timely consensus cannot be reached, the majority will rule; conflicts will be
-resolved directly with the parties involved. 
-
-
-
- 
-
-
-### Successful team building, which results in effective, focused work teams, necessitates paying attention to each of the following:
-
-
-
-
-Clear Expectations: for the team's
-performance and expected outcomes.
-
-
-
-        
-Context: Do team members understand why
-they are on the team? Do they understand how the team-building strategy will
-help the organisation achieve its goals? Is the team aware of how its work fits
-into the larger picture of the organization's goals, principles, vision, and
-values?
-
-
-
-        
-Commitment: Do team members want to be a
-part of the team? Do team members believe the team's mission is important? Are
-team members committed to achieving the team's mission and goals? Do team
-members expect their skills to grow and develop on the team? Are team members
-excited and challenged by the team opportunity?
-
-
-
- 
-
-
-
-### As professionals, we will work hard to: 
-
-
-
-
-Be on time, adhere to agenda item time limits,
-and plan to stay for the duration of the meeting. 
-
-
-
-      
-Communicate directly and openly. 
-
-
-
-
-Be polite, listen carefully, and respect other
-people's opinions. 
-
-
-
-
-Participate fully in the group exchange by
-avoiding sideline conversations, cross-talk, and distracting behaviours. 
-
-
-
-
-Be adaptable and open to new ideas and changes. 
-
-
-
-
-Keep your focus on the task at hand and don't
-get distracted by other, unrelated issues. 
-
-
-
-
-Assume positive attention from others, and give
-them the benefit of the doubt. 
-
-
-
-
-Be solution-focused, looking for opportunities,
-challenges, and opportunities, rather than dwelling on past slights,
-roadblocks, or excuses.
-
-
-
-
-Strive for consensus when making decisions; if
-that fails, a simple majority vote will be used. 
-
-
-
-
-Respect that decision, even if it is not in your
-best interests. Make decisions based on what is best for the children, families,
-and centre, not what is expedient or easy.
